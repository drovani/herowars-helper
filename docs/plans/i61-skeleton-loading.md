# Skeleton Loading Implementation Plan

**GitHub Issue**: [#61 - Implement skeleton loading for better perceived performance](https://github.com/drovani/herowars-helper/issues/61)

## Overview
Implement comprehensive skeleton loading components throughout the Hero Wars Helper application to improve perceived performance and user experience. This addresses the code review recommendation by replacing basic loading spinners with contextual skeleton placeholders that match the final content layout, especially for data-heavy pages like hero grids, equipment catalogs, and mission lists.

## Branch Strategy
Create branch: `feature/i61-skeleton-loading-implementation`

## Prerequisites
Files to examine and understand before starting:
- `/app/components/ui/skeleton.tsx` - Existing shadcn/ui skeleton component
- `/app/routes/views/heroes/index.tsx` - Hero grid loading patterns
- `/app/routes/views/equipment/index.tsx` - Equipment grid loading patterns  
- `/app/routes/views/missions/index.tsx` - Mission list loading patterns
- `/app/layouts/ProtectedLayout.tsx` - Current auth loading patterns
- `/app/components/admin/` - Admin loading state implementations
- `/app/routes/views/heroes/slug.tsx` - Hero detail loading patterns

## Dependency Analysis
### Current Loading State Files
- **Auth Loading**: `/app/layouts/ProtectedLayout.tsx` (simple spinner + text)
- **Form Loading**: Login forms, admin setup, user management with text changes
- **Route Loaders**: All major routes use server-side data loading
- **Fetcher Operations**: Admin components with optimistic UI updates
- **Available Component**: Skeleton component already installed from shadcn/ui

### Impact Assessment
- **High Impact**: Hero/Equipment/Mission index pages (50+ items), hero detail pages
- **Medium Impact**: Admin data tables, complex forms with multi-step processes
- **Low Impact**: Simple authentication flows, quick form submissions
- **Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours per major skeleton component type
- **Risk Factors**: Over-engineering simple loading states, layout shift during skeleton-to-content transition
