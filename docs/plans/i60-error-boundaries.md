# Error Boundaries Implementation Plan

**GitHub Issue**: [#60 - Implement comprehensive React error boundaries for better error handling](https://github.com/drovani/herowars-helper/issues/60)

## Overview
Implement comprehensive React error boundaries throughout the Hero Wars Helper application to provide better error handling, user experience, and debugging capabilities. This plan addresses the code review recommendation by strategically placing error boundaries at key application layers while maintaining consistency with existing error handling patterns.

## Branch Strategy
Create branch: `feature/i60-error-boundaries-implementation`

## Prerequisites
Files to examine and understand before starting:
- `/app/root.tsx` - Current root-level error boundary
- `/app/components/player/PlayerCollectionErrorBoundary.tsx` - Existing specialized error boundary
- `/app/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication error patterns
- `/app/repositories/BaseRepository.ts` - Repository error handling
- `/app/layouts/` - Layout component structure
- `/app/components/ui/` - Available UI components for error displays

## Dependency Analysis
### Files Using Error Handling Patterns
- **Root Application**: `/app/root.tsx` (lines 86-110) - Basic error boundary
- **Player Collection**: `/app/components/player/PlayerCollectionErrorBoundary.tsx` - Specialized boundary
- **Auth Context**: `/app/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Try-catch with loglevel
- **Repository Layer**: All repositories use consistent `RepositoryResult<T>` pattern
- **Forms**: Hero, Equipment, Mission forms have basic error handling

### Impact Assessment
- **High Impact**: Layout-level boundaries, form boundaries
- **Medium Impact**: Feature-specific boundaries, data loading boundaries
- **Low Impact**: Utility component boundaries
- **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours per major boundary component
- **Risk Factors**: Potential over-wrapping, performance impact with too many boundaries

## Phase 1: Core Error Boundary Infrastructure

### 1.1 Create Base Error Boundary Component
- Create `/app/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` with configurable options
- Support retry mechanisms, custom fallback UIs, and error reporting
- Integrate with existing `loglevel` logging patterns
- Include development vs production error display modes
- Support error context (user info, route, component stack)

### 1.2 Update Existing Error Boundary
- Fix logging inconsistency in `PlayerCollectionErrorBoundary.tsx` (replace `console.error` with `loglevel`)
- Enhance with base error boundary features
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing usage

### 1.3 Create Error Boundary Hook
- Create `/app/hooks/useErrorBoundary.tsx` for manual error throwing
- Allow components to trigger error boundary from async operations
- Integrate with repository error patterns

## Phase 2: Layout-Level Error Boundaries

### 2.1 Protected Layout Error Boundaries
- Wrap `/app/layouts/ProtectedLayout.tsx` with authentication-specific error boundary
- Handle auth token expiration, permission errors, role verification failures
- Provide user-friendly messages with appropriate actions (re-login, contact admin)

### 2.2 Feature Layout Error Boundaries
- Add error boundaries to admin layout (`ProtectedAdminLayout.tsx`)
- Add error boundaries to editor layout (`ProtectedEditorLayout.tsx`)
- Add error boundaries to user layout (`ProtectedUserLayout.tsx`)
- Each boundary should handle role-specific error scenarios

### 2.3 Route-Level Error Boundaries
- Enhance route loader error handling in `/app/routes.ts`
- Create route-specific error boundaries for data-heavy routes
- Implement proper error propagation from loaders to UI

## Phase 3: Feature-Specific Error Boundaries

### 3.1 Hero Management Error Boundary
- Create `/app/components/heroes/HeroErrorBoundary.tsx`
- Handle hero data loading, form submission, and validation errors
- Wrap hero routes and forms with appropriate error handling
- Support hero data recovery and retry mechanisms

### 3.2 Equipment Management Error Boundary
- Create `/app/components/equipment/EquipmentErrorBoundary.tsx`
- Handle equipment catalog loading and form submission errors
- Support equipment data validation and recovery
- Integrate with equipment repository error patterns

### 3.3 Mission Management Error Boundary
- Create `/app/components/missions/MissionErrorBoundary.tsx`
- Handle chapter/mission data loading and cross-reference errors
- Support mission planning error recovery
- Handle equipment drop location validation

### 3.4 Player Collection Error Boundary Enhancement
- Extend existing `PlayerCollectionErrorBoundary.tsx`
- Add support for roster management errors
- Integrate with player data repository patterns
- Support collection state recovery

## Phase 4: Form and Data Loading Error Boundaries

### 4.1 Form Error Boundary Component
- Create `/app/components/forms/FormErrorBoundary.tsx`
- Preserve user input during error recovery
- Handle validation errors and network failures
- Support form state restoration after error resolution

### 4.2 Data Loading Error Boundary
- Create `/app/components/data/DataLoadingErrorBoundary.tsx`
- Handle repository errors and network failures
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Support offline/online state management

### 4.3 Critical Form Wrapping
- Wrap `HeroForm.tsx` with form error boundary
- Wrap `EquipmentForm.tsx` with form error boundary
- Wrap `MissionForm.tsx` with form error boundary
- Ensure form state preservation during errors

## Phase 5: Navigation and UI Error Boundaries

### 5.1 Navigation Error Boundary
- Create `/app/components/navigation/NavigationErrorBoundary.tsx`
- Handle sidebar navigation errors and breadcrumb failures
- Support navigation state recovery
- Graceful degradation for navigation features

### 5.2 Component-Level Error Boundaries
- Add error boundaries to complex UI components
- Focus on components with external data dependencies
- Implement graceful fallbacks for non-critical features

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
