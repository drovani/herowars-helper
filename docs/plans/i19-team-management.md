# Team Management System Implementation (Issue #19)

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive team management system that allows users to create, label, and manage teams of exactly 5 heroes. Teams automatically display heroes in descending order by order_rank (left to right), reflecting the in-game team display format. This feature extends the existing player hero collection system with strategic team planning capabilities.

## Branch Strategy
**Branch Name**: `feature/i19-team-management`
- **Type**: `feature/` - New functionality for team creation and management
- **Base Branch**: `main`
- **Target**: Enable users to create labeled teams with exactly 5 heroes (auto-ordered by rank)

## Prerequisites
### Files to Examine and Understand
- `app/types/supabase.ts` - Database schema and types
- `app/repositories/PlayerHeroRepository.ts` - Existing player hero management patterns
- `app/routes/views/player/roster.tsx` - Current player collection UI patterns
- `app/data/navigation.ts` - Navigation structure for new team pages
- `app/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication patterns
- `app/components/player/HeroCollectionCard.tsx` - Existing hero display components

### Database Schema Analysis
Current relevant tables:
- `player_hero`: User hero collection with stars/equipment tracking
- `hero`: Master hero data with team_buff fields
- Need to create: `player_team` and `player_team_hero` tables
- Note: Teams display heroes by order_rank (descending), no manual positioning

## Dependency Analysis
### Files Using Player Hero System
- `/app/routes/views/player/roster.tsx` - Player collection management
- `/app/repositories/PlayerHeroRepository.ts` - Database operations
- `/app/components/player/HeroCollectionCard.tsx` - Hero display component
- Integration patterns for team selection from existing collection

### Impact Assessment
- **Impact Level**: Medium - New feature with database schema changes
- **Estimated Development Time**: 3-4 days
- **Risk Factors**: Database migration, new component creation, state management
- **Mitigation**: Follow existing repository patterns, comprehensive testing

## Phase 1: Database Schema and Repository Foundation ✅ COMPLETED
### 1.1 Database Schema Design
- [x] Create `player_team` table schema (id, user_id, name, description, created_at, updated_at)
- [x] Implement default naming pattern: "Team 1", "Team 2", etc. for new teams
- [x] Create `player_team_hero` table schema (id, team_id, hero_slug, created_at)
- [x] Add foreign key constraints and indexes (no position field needed - use hero.order_rank)
- [x] Generate Supabase types with `npm run supabase:types`

### 1.2 Repository Implementation
- [x] Create `PlayerTeamRepository.ts` extending BaseRepository
- [x] Implement CRUD operations: create, findByUserId, update, delete

- [x] Implement team hero management: addHeroToTeam, removeHeroFromTeam (no positioning needed)
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling and validation
- [x] Implement team validation (exactly 5 heroes max)

### 1.3 Types and Interfaces
- [x] Define `PlayerTeam`, `PlayerTeamHero`, `TeamWithHeroes` types
- [x] Update `app/repositories/types.ts` with team-related types
- [x] Create Zod validation schemas for team creation/updates

**Phase 1 Progress Notes:** *Completed 2025-07-19 14:11 UTC - All database schema, repository implementation, and testing complete. Heroes automatically ordered by order_rank (descending). All 10 unit tests passing with TypeScript strict compliance.*

## Phase 2: Core Team Management Components ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Implement responsive grid layout for multiple teams

### 2.2 Team Builder Component  
- [x] Create `TeamBuilder.tsx` for team creation/editing
- [x] Implement 5-hero selection interface (auto-ordered by rank)
- [x] Include hero selection from user's collection with search/filter
- [x] Validate team composition (exactly 5 heroes, no duplicates)
- [x] Display preview ordered by order_rank (descending)

### 2.3 Team Hero Display Component
- [x] Create `TeamHeroDisplay.tsx` for showing heroes in rank order
- [x] Display hero image, name, stars, equipment level, order_rank

**Phase 2 Progress Notes:** *Completed 2025-07-19 14:25 UTC - All core UI components created with responsive design, search/filter capabilities, and automatic hero ordering by rank.*

## Phase 3: Team Management Routes and Navigation ✅ COMPLETED
### 3.1 Team Management Routes
- [x] Create `/app/routes/views/player/teams/index.tsx` - Team list page
- [x] Create `/app/routes/views/player/teams/new.tsx` - Team creation page

- [x] Add authentication guards and error boundaries

### 3.2 Navigation Integration
- [x] Add "Team Management" item to Player Tools navigation section
- [x] Update `app/data/navigation.ts` with team routes
- [x] Add appropriate icons (Users/Shield combination)
- [x] Ensure proper role-based access (authenticated users only)

**Phase 3 Progress Notes:** *Completed 2025-07-19 14:25 UTC - All routes implemented with full CRUD operations, TypeScript strict compliance, and proper authentication guards.*

## Phase 4: Advanced Features and UX Enhancements
