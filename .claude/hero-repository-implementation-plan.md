# Hero Repository Implementation Plan

**Related Issue**: [#38 - Create Hero Repository and Database Schema](https://github.com/drovani/herowars-helper/issues/38)

## Overview
Implement comprehensive database schema for heroes and create HeroRepository extending BaseRepository. This involves migrating from JSON-based HeroDataService to database-backed hero management with complex relationships for artifacts, skins, glyphs, and equipment.

## Branch Strategy
`feature/hero-repository` - New functionality for database-backed hero management replacing JSON-based service

## Prerequisites
Files to examine and understand before starting:
- `app/repositories/BaseRepository.ts` - Repository pattern implementation (from #35)
- `app/data/heroes.json` - Current hero data structure
- `app/data/hero.zod.ts` - Existing hero validation schemas
- `app/services/HeroDataService.ts` - Current service implementation
- `app/types/supabase.ts` - Database schema definitions
- `app/repositories/EquipmentRepository.ts` - Complex relationship patterns

## Dependency Analysis

### Files Using HeroDataService
Based on current usage patterns:
- `app/routes/views/heroes/index.tsx` - Hero listing page
- `app/routes/views/heroes/slug.tsx` - Hero details page
- `app/routes/views/heroes/slug/edit.tsx` - Hero editing (editor only)
- `app/components/hero/` - All hero-related components
- `app/routes/views/admin/data-setup/heroes.tsx` - Admin data management

### Current Hero Data Structure
Complex nested structure requiring multiple related tables:
- **Core Hero Data**: slug, name, class, faction, main_stat, attack_type, stone_source
- **Equipment Items**: Quality-level nested object with 6-slot arrays
- **Artifacts**: Weapon (with team buff), book, ring structure
- **Skins**: Array of skins with stats and plus variants
- **Glyphs**: Array of exactly 5 stats (5th matches main_stat)

### Impact Assessment
- **High Impact**: Complete data layer transformation
- **Medium Risk**: Complex relationships and data migration
- **Estimated Time**: 3-4 phases, 15-20 tasks total
- **Migration Strategy**: Gradual replacement of service calls
