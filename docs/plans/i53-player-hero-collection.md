# Player Hero Collection System Implementation Plan

## Overview

Implement a hero collection tracking system for Hero Wars Helper that allows authenticated users to track their personal hero progression including stars (1-6) and equipment levels (1-16). This feature enables players to manage their roster and track development progress.

## Branch Strategy

Create feature branch: `feature/i53-player-hero-collection`

## Prerequisites

- Review existing authentication patterns in `app/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Understand BaseRepository and HeroRepository implementations
- Examine existing route structure in `app/routes.ts`
- Study Supabase RLS patterns from hero tables migration

## Dependency Analysis

### Files Using Player Data (New Implementation)

- New `PlayerHeroRepository` extending `BaseRepository`
- New player routes under `ProtectedUserLayout`
- Navigation updates for Player Tools section
- UI components for hero collection management

### Impact Assessment

- **Medium impact** - New feature addition without breaking existing functionality
- **Estimated time**: 4-6 hours implementation + testing
- **Risk factors**: RLS policy configuration, authentication integration

## Phase 1: Database Schema & Repository

### 1.1 Create Player Hero Database Migration

- Create `supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_player_hero_collection.sql`
- Define `player_hero` table with:
  - `id` (uuid, primary key)
  - `user_id` (uuid, foreign key to auth.users)
  - `hero_slug` (text, foreign key to hero table)
  - `stars` (smallint, 1-6 range)
  - `equipment_level` (smallint, 1-16 range)
  - Unique constraint on `(user_id, hero_slug)`
- Define `player_event` table for event sourcing:
  - `id` (uuid, primary key)
  - `user_id` (uuid, foreign key to auth.users)
  - `event_type` (text, enum: CLAIM_HERO, UNCLAIM_HERO, UPDATE_HERO_STARS, UPDATE_HERO_EQUIPMENT)
  - `hero_slug` (text, foreign key to hero table)
  - `event_data` (jsonb, stores action-specific data like previous/new values)
  - `created_at` (timestamptz, default now())
  - `created_by` (uuid, foreign key to auth.users - who performed the action)
- Implement RLS policies for user-only access on both tables
- Create appropriate indexes for performance (including event queries by user and type)
- Run `npx supabase reset` to reset the local database and process migrations & seed data

### 1.2 Update Supabase Types

- Run `npm run supabase:types` to regenerate types
- Update `app/repositories/types.ts` with new PlayerHero and PlayerEvent types

### 1.3 Create PlayerEventRepository

- Create `app/repositories/PlayerEventRepository.ts`
- Extend BaseRepository for event sourcing operations
- Implement methods:
  - `createEvent(eventType: string, userId: string, heroSlug: string, eventData: object)` - Record new event
  - `findEventsByUser(userId: string)` - Get user's event history
  - `findEventsByHero(userId: string, heroSlug: string)` - Get hero-specific events
  - `findEventsByType(userId: string, eventType: string)` - Get events by type

### 1.4 Create PlayerHeroRepository

- Create `app/repositories/PlayerHeroRepository.ts`
- Extend BaseRepository with custom authentication-aware queries
- Integrate event sourcing for all state changes
- Implement methods:
  - `findByUserId(userId: string)` - Get user's collection
  - `addHeroToCollection(userId: string, heroSlug: string)` - Add hero + record CLAIM_HERO event
  - `updateHeroProgress(userId: string, heroSlug: string, updates)` - Update progression + record UPDATE events
  - `removeFromCollection(userId: string, heroSlug: string)` - Remove hero + record UNCLAIM_HERO event
  - `findWithHeroDetails(userId: string)` - Get collection with hero metadata
  - All mutation methods should create corresponding events via PlayerEventRepository

## Phase 2: Player Routes & Navigation ✅ COMPLETED (2025-01-16)

### 2.1 Update Routes Configuration ✅

- ✅ Modified `app/routes.ts` to add player routes under `ProtectedUserLayout`:

    ]),
    route("player", "./routes/views/player/layout.tsx", [
      index("./routes/views/player/roster.tsx"),
      route("activity", "./routes/views/player/activity.tsx"),
    ]),
  ]);
  ```

### 2.2 Create Player Route Components ✅

- ✅ Created `app/routes/views/player/layout.tsx` - Player section layout with breadcrumb support

    items: [
      {
        name: "Hero Roster",
        icon: UsersRoundIcon,
        href: "/player"
      },
      {
        name: "Activity Log",
